# Example Servers

> A list of example servers and implementations

This page showcases various Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that demonstrate the protocol's capabilities and versatility. These servers enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to securely access tools and data sources.

## Reference implementations

These official reference servers demonstrate core MCP features and SDK usage:

### Current reference servers

* **[Everything](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/everything)** - Reference / test server with prompts, resources, and tools
* **[Fetch](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch)** - Web content fetching and conversion for efficient LLM usage
* **[Filesystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem)** - Secure file operations with configurable access controls
* **[Git](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git)** - Tools to read, search, and manipulate Git repositories
* **[Memory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory)** - Knowledge graph-based persistent memory system
* **[Sequential Thinking](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking)** - Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thought sequences
* **[Time](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/time)** - Time and timezone conversion capabilities

## Getting started

### Using reference servers

TypeScript-based servers can be used directly with `npx`:

```bash  theme={null}
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers can be used with `uvx` (recommended) or `pip`:

```bash  theme={null}
# Using uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# Using pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

### Configuring with Claude

To use an MCP server with Claude, add it to your configuration:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/allowed/files"
      ]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
