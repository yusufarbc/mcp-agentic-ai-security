**This repository serves as a permanent research archive for the critical security analysis of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem.** It aggregates theoretical architectures, threat models, empirical benchmarks, and an accompanying IEEE-format research paper.

## 📄 Abstract

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced in late 2024, marks a significant turning point in the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). By standardizing the interface between AI agents and external data, MCP seeks to dismantle the "N × M" integration barrier. However, this capabilities upgrade introduces a "Lethal Trifecta" of security risks: Data Access, Internet Connectivity, and Action Capability. This research archive critically synthesizes the emerging ecosystem, analyzing the shift towards a "Code Execution Paradigm" and proposing necessary governance frameworks to ensure the ecosystem matures securely.
